**Version 1.2**

**Effective Date:** **January 08, 2026**

This General Services Agreement (“**Agreement**”) sets out the general terms governing the professional services provided by **DripHQ Consulting Services LLP**, doing business as **DripDigital** (“**DripDigital**”, “**we**”, “**us**”), to its clients (“**Client**”, “**you**”).

This Agreement is intended to establish clarity, fairness, and a shared understanding of the working relationship between the parties. It governs all engagements between DripDigital and a Client unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing.

---

## 1. Scope of Services (General)

DripDigital provides professional services across areas such as strategy, design, technology, digital marketing, content, and related consulting services (the “**Services**”).

The specific scope, deliverables, timelines, and commercial terms applicable to any engagement will be set out in a separate written agreement, order form, or engagement document agreed between DripDigital and the Client (an “**Engagement Agreement**”).

DripDigital’s obligations are limited strictly to the Services expressly described in the applicable Engagement Agreement. No additional services, deliverables, availability, or outcomes shall be implied based on prior discussions, industry practice, or the nature of the Services, unless mutually agreed in writing.

---

## 2. Engagement Structure

Each engagement between DripDigital and a Client consists of:

- this General Services Agreement; and
- the applicable Engagement Agreement.

The Engagement Agreement incorporates this Agreement by reference and forms an integral part of the contractual relationship between the parties.

The version of this Agreement in effect on the date the Engagement Agreement is executed shall apply to that engagement, notwithstanding any later updates to this Agreement.

In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and an Engagement Agreement, the terms of the Engagement Agreement shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency. Obligations not expressly stated in either document shall not be binding on either party.

---

## 3. Relationship of the Parties

DripDigital and the Client are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement or any Engagement Agreement creates or is intended to create any partnership, joint venture, agency, employment, fiduciary, or representative relationship between the parties.

Each party retains sole control over its personnel, methods of work, and internal operations, and neither party has authority to bind the other.

---

## 4. Client Responsibilities and Cooperation

The Client acknowledges that effective delivery of the Services depends on timely cooperation. The Client agrees to:

- provide accurate and complete information, materials, and inputs as reasonably required;
- review and respond to deliverables or requests within reasonable timeframes; and
- designate an authorized point of contact to provide instructions, feedback, and approvals.

Delays or failures by the Client to meet these responsibilities may impact timelines, outcomes, or the ability of DripDigital to perform the Services, and shall not constitute a breach by DripDigital.

---

## 5. Fees, Invoicing, and Payment Principles

Fees, invoicing schedules, and payment terms applicable to specific Services are defined in the relevant Engagement Agreement.

Unless otherwise agreed:

- invoices are payable within the timelines specified in the Engagement Agreement; and
- payments shall be made without set-off or deduction, except as required by law.

Timely payment is essential for effective service delivery. DripDigital reserves the right to suspend Services, withhold deliverables, or pause further work if invoices remain unpaid beyond agreed payment terms. During any period of non-payment, DripDigital shall have no obligation to continue performance or meet delivery timelines.

All fees paid for Services performed are non-refundable.

---

## 6. Changes to Scope

The Client acknowledges that Services may evolve over the course of an engagement. Any material change to the scope, deliverables, assumptions, or timelines described in an Engagement Agreement may require corresponding adjustments to fees, timelines, or both, as mutually agreed in writing.

DripDigital is not obligated to perform materially changed or additional services unless such changes are agreed and documented.

---

## 7. Ownership and Intellectual Property

### 7.1 Client Deliverables

Subject to full payment of all undisputed amounts due, the Client shall own all final deliverables expressly created for the Client under an Engagement Agreement.

### 7.2 Client Materials

The Client retains ownership of all materials, content, data, and intellectual property provided to DripDigital (“**Client Materials**”). The Client represents and warrants that it has all necessary rights to provide such Client Materials and shall be solely responsible for their legality, accuracy, and compliance with applicable laws.

### 7.3 DripDigital Materials

DripDigital retains all right, title, and interest in its pre-existing materials, tools, frameworks, methodologies, templates, processes, know-how, and general expertise (“**DripDigital Materials**”).

To the extent any DripDigital Materials are incorporated into Client deliverables, the Client is granted a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free license to use such materials solely as necessary for its internal business operations and intended use of the deliverables. No rights to resell, sublicense, or commercially exploit DripDigital Materials are granted unless expressly agreed in writing.

### 7.4 Portfolio and Publicity

Unless otherwise agreed in writing, DripDigital may identify the Client as a customer and use publicly available, non-confidential materials for portfolio, marketing, and case study purposes. Such use shall be factual and shall not imply endorsement.

---

## 8. Confidentiality

Each party may receive confidential or proprietary information from the other in connection with the Services (“**Confidential Information**”).

Each party agrees to:

- use Confidential Information solely for purposes of performing or receiving the Services;
- restrict disclosure of Confidential Information to its employees, contractors, or advisors on a need-to-know basis; and
- protect Confidential Information using reasonable care.

Confidential Information does not include information that:

- is or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement;
- is lawfully received from a third party without restriction; or
- was independently developed without reference to the Confidential Information.

Upon termination of an engagement, Confidential Information shall be returned or destroyed upon reasonable request. Confidentiality obligations survive termination of this Agreement.

---

## 9. Term and Termination

This Agreement remains in effect until terminated by either party.

Either party may terminate this Agreement or any Engagement Agreement by providing written notice as specified in the applicable Engagement Agreement. If no notice period is specified, either party may terminate upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.

Termination does not relieve the Client of its obligation to pay for Services performed or expenses incurred up to the effective date of termination. Fees paid for completed work are non-refundable.

Upon termination, both parties shall cooperate in good faith to ensure an orderly transition, subject to payment status and the scope of Services performed.

---

## 10. Suspension of Services

DripDigital may temporarily suspend Services if:

- the Client fails to meet payment obligations; or
- Client actions or omissions materially prevent DripDigital from performing the Services.

Any suspension shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement and shall not extend deadlines or timelines unless expressly agreed in writing.

---

## 11. Warranties and Disclaimers

DripDigital warrants that Services will be performed in a professional and workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable laws.

The Client warrants that any materials, information, or instructions it provides do not infringe the rights of third parties and that it has authority to provide them.

Except as expressly stated, DripDigital makes no warranties or guarantees regarding specific outcomes, business results, performance metrics, or commercial success arising from the Services.

---

## 12. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

- neither party shall be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages; and
- each party’s total aggregate liability under this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by the Client to DripDigital in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

These limitations do not apply to breaches of confidentiality, intellectual property obligations, or indemnification obligations.

---

## 13. Indemnification

Each party agrees to indemnify and hold the other harmless against third-party claims arising from:

- its breach of this Agreement;
- its negligence or willful misconduct; or
- in the case of the Client, any claim arising from Client Materials or instructions provided to DripDigital.

This indemnification does not apply to disputes or claims directly between the parties.

---

## 14. Force Majeure

Neither party shall be liable for failure or delay in performance due to events beyond its reasonable control, including natural disasters, acts of government, labor disturbances, or similar force majeure events. Performance shall resume as soon as reasonably practicable.

---

## 15. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

The parties shall first attempt to resolve disputes through good-faith discussions.

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of India. Subject to the foregoing, the courts at **Mangaluru, Karnataka**, shall have exclusive jurisdiction.

---

## 16. Assignment

Neither party may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other, except in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of substantially all of its assets.

---

## 17. Amendments and Waivers

Any amendment to this Agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. Failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver of that provision.

---

## 18. Entire Agreement and Severability

This Agreement, together with any Engagement Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between the parties regarding the Services. If any provision is held unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.

---

## 19. Versioning

This Agreement is versioned and published for transparency. Engagements are governed by the version in effect on the date the relevant Engagement Agreement is executed.
