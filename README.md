# DripDigital – General Services Agreement (GSA)

This repository contains the official **General Services Agreement (GSA)** for **DripDigital**.

The GSA defines the standard legal, commercial, and relationship terms that govern how DripDigital works with clients. It is designed to provide clarity, fairness, and consistency across all engagements, while allowing individual projects to be scoped separately.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository exists to:

- Maintain a **single source of truth** for DripDigital’s General Services Agreement
- Provide **versioned transparency** for clients and partners
- Ensure consistency between the **public website GSA** and client engagements
- Allow internal tracking of changes over time

This repository does **not** contain client-specific contracts, scopes of work, or commercial details.

## How This GSA Is Used

DripDigital operates using a two-layer contract structure:

1. **General Services Agreement (GSA)**  
   - Governs the overall working relationship  
   - Covers ownership, confidentiality, liability, termination, dispute resolution, and general principles  

2. **Engagement Agreement (shared privately with clients)**  
   - Defines project-specific scope, deliverables, timelines, and fees  
   - Incorporates the GSA by reference  

Clients sign **only the Engagement Agreement**, which references the applicable version of the GSA.

---

## Public Website Version

The authoritative, client-facing version of the General Services Agreement is published on the DripDigital website:

**https://dripdigital.in/legal/general-services-agreement**  

The website version is the version that applies to client engagements, as referenced in signed Engagement Agreements.

---

## Versioning Policy

- Each update to the GSA is versioned (e.g. `v1.0`, `v1.1`, `v1.2`)
- Engagements are governed by the **version in effect on the date the Engagement Agreement is executed**
- Updates to the GSA are **not applied retroactively** to existing engagements unless expressly agreed in writing
